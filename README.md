## Instructions

#### The Files

1. **Fork** [this repository](https://github.com/JoinCODED/TASK-objects-iterators-books-authors) and clone your fork (make sure you clone it into your `development` directory):
2. Navigate to the project root (you'll find a file called `package.json` there).
3. Install the requirements using `npm install`.

#### Running The Tests

Run the tests:

```bash
$ npm test
```

This command will run the testing file and test your code to make sure it has all the required features.

You'll know when you're done when your code passes all the tests.
